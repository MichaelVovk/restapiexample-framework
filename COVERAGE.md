Scenario Outline: Test with invalid or missing inputs
Given the API endpoint "<endpoint>"
And invalid or missing inputs are provided
When a <method> request is sent to the endpoint
Then an error response with appropriate error message is received

    Examples:
    | endpoint                                                 | method |

    | "https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/delete/{id}"    | DELETE |

# Additional scenarios for edge cases, error handling, performance, etc. can be added as needed.
